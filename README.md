In Wordle, the options are often greatly reduced after the first word has been selected. In this task, we will filter out an unfortunate first guess.					
Imagine that your first guess is "zippy" and it shows that none of these letters are in the mystery word.
We are going to create a VBA function that will return whether the word could be the mystery word given  "zippy"  had nothing in common with the mystery word.
